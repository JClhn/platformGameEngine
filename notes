----write function to deal with image smoothing on all browsers
----write sprite switching routine for objects


image->sprite->gameObject->room->game

image->background->room->game

image->map->room->game

image is the bitmap resource itself

there's no good reason that code should not be written in such a way that 
it's function is dead obvious.

it's silly to incorporate a whole framework to save yourself from writting
three lines of code.
